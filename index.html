<h1>little bit about me</h1>
 <p>
   My name is Hassan yousuf, and I'm new to coding.
Before I started IDP, the most technological program I've worked
with was AutoCAD-for one year. I do find myself in a big learning curve with coding for a bit,
but I know with practice I'll get better.
 </p>

 <p>
   I'm not always coding though. In my spare time, I volunteer in
the community frequently and exercise abnormally late at night.
And thanks to my brother, I've developed an obsession with anime, when I was younger
I would draw characters all day long.
 </p>

 <p>
   The reason I've joined this program is so that I could learn new skills
 to put my creativity to real use in the industry.
 I hope to become an app developer
 in the future and as building a marketing company for smaller businesses with out of date
 marketing strategies.
